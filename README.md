# OpenGL examples with PyOpenGL and Pygame
The OpenGL examples are based on the book "Developing Graphics Frameworks with Python and OpenGL" by Lee Stemkoski and Michael Pascale published by CRC Press in 2022. 

The examples cover the book chapters from 2 through 4 with slight changes and demonstrate GLSL programming by PyOpenGL. Pygame is used for control, windowing, and image loading.

You can find the examples themselves in the examples folder. Just read the class description and run the script. Since the object-oriented approach is used, the auxiliary classes necessary for the examples are logically separated in other folders.

You need also to install the following used packages or later:
- numpy 1.21.1
- pygame 2.0.1
- PyOpenGL 3.1.5
- PyOpenGL-accelerate 3.1.5
