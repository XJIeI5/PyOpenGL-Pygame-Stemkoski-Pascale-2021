# OpenGL examples with PyOpenGL and Pygame
The OpenGL examples are based on book "Developing Graphics Frameworks with Python and OpenGL" by Lee Stemkoski and Michael Pascale published by CRC Press in 2021. 

The examples cover the book chapters from 2 through 5 with some changes and demonstrate GLSL programming by PyOpenGL. Pygame is used for control, windowing, and image loading.

You find the examples in an examples folder (package). Just read a class description in a script and run it. Since the object-oriented approach is used, auxiliary classes are logically separated in other folders (packages).

Together with Python 3.8+, you need also the following packages or later:
- numpy 1.22.4
- pygame 2.1.2
- PyOpenGL 3.1.6
- PyOpenGL-accelerate 3.1.6
