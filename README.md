# OpenGL examples with PyOpenGL and Pygame
OpenGL examples with PyOpenGL and Pygame are based on the book "Developing Graphics Frameworks with Python and OpenGL" by Lee Stemkoski and Michael Pascale published by CRC Press in 2022. 

The examples cover the book chapters from 2 through 4 with slight changes (which are not critical for understanding the content) and demonstrate GLSL programming by PyOpenGL. Pygame is used for control and the windowing system.

You need also to install the following packages or later:
- numpy 1.21.1
- pygame 2.0.1
- PyOpenGL 3.1.5
- PyOpenGL-accelerate 3.1.5
